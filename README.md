# serverHuD
Web based heads up display for servers

## ToDo:

- Replace 'any' with types where I haven't.
- Implementing an uptime graph.
- Implementing PWA
- Client side form validation.
- hud-server authentication.
- Make sure duplicates can't be added
- Replace polling with webhooks or something.
- Integrate user email verification and email alerts.

## Secondary Server

If you'd like to run serverHuD with the optional Go server on your linux servers,
simply deploy the hud-server project on this repo to your linux server. When you
enter your server to be monitored, put the url or IP of the endpoint you configured
